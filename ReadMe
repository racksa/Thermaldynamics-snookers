*****************************
1) File composition
*****************************
The programme contains 3 main files:
- TR_driver.py
- TR_gas.py
- TR_ball.py

and 1 ReadMe file.
- ReadMe

All 3 main files MUST be placed under the SAME repository.


*****************************
2) Implementation
*****************************
To implement the simulation, only run TR_driver.py with Python (version 3 or higher).

The section in TR_driver.py, lines 27-81 provides the parameters that you may want to modify to investigate the physics.

Defaults values of the parameters are good to go.

No need to change any other code apart from this section.

The first part in the section includes general settings, i.e., how you want to implement the simulation.

The second part enables you to generate a new gas of desired properties.


*****************************
3) Saving and loading
*****************************
The programme enables you to save the current instance for later uses.

At the end of each run, the current instance of gas will automatically be saved as '../TR_save'.

If '../TR_save' already exists, the new file will OVERWRITE the previous file - change the name of saved file if you want to keep it.

Change the value of 'enable_loading' in TR_driver.py, line 53 to enable/disable the loading function.

Specify the saved file name in TR_driver.py, line 56, if necessary.


*****************************
4) Animation
*****************************
If using Spyder to implement the code, follow the procedures below to enable animations.

- Do not use IPython console 

- Select Python console window in Spyder -> close all tabs -> right click -> cLick 'Run' option -> nevigate to the repository -> Select TR_driver.py -> Run.

Important note: Trying to use the opened Python console to run will fail. Therefore all tabs must be closed.

For 3-D gases, animation can still be enabled, but only the projection will be plotted.


*****************************
5) Mixed particle and Brownian
*****************************
To generate gases containing mixed particles, simply append elements in TR_driver.py, lines 68-75.

Change the value of the variable in TR_driver.py, lines 78-81 to enable/disable the investigation of Brownian particles.
